# Lab exercise 3 objectives
1. Practice writing C++ classes.
2. Practice designing class member variables and member functions.

# Instructions
Answer the programming problems sequentially (i.e., answer prob01 before prob02). 
If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates.

To get started on problem 1, change into the `prob01` directory. If you haven't already, change into the lab03 directory:
```
cd lab03-<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

Then change into the prob01 folder and view the README for its instructions:
```
cd prob01
```

You need to complete `prob01` and `prob02`. `prob03-extra` is not graded, but there for additional practice.
